# Scam Email Identification 🕵️‍♂️📧
Welcome to the Scam Email Identification project, where we use the power of machine learning to fight back against scam emails! This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook, Scam_Email_Identification_using_RFC.ipynb, that outlines our journey in creating a model capable of distinguishing scam emails from legitimate ones.

# About the Project 📘
Every day, millions of scam emails are sent out, tricking unsuspecting individuals into parting with their hard-earned money or confidential information. Our mission is to develop a machine learning model that can help identify these scam emails, providing an additional layer of security for email users. We utilize a RandomForestClassifier (RFC) for its robustness and ability to handle imbalanced datasets, a common challenge in scam detection tasks.

# Features 🌟
Data Preprocessing: Dive into how we clean and prepare our email dataset for the machine learning model, ensuring optimal performance.
Feature Engineering: Discover the techniques we employ to extract meaningful features from emails that help differentiate scams from legitimate correspondence.
Model Training and Evaluation: Follow along as we train our RandomForestClassifier and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Insights and Visualization: Gain insights from our analysis with visual representations of the model's performance and the feature importance rankings.
